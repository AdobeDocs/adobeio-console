## Answers

### Why is the service I want to use greyed out?

Many services require a paid license or subscription to use. If you believe you should have access to a disabled service, please contact your Adobe sales representative.

If you are a member of an enterprise organization, please note that either System Admin or Developer permissions are required to access services.

### How do I delete Runtime from my project or workspace?

Currently it is not possible to remove Runtime from a project. Please create a new project instead.

### What is a workspace?

Workspaces are currently only available when building Project Firefly apps. Workspaces allow you to collaborate with other developers on your team as part of the same larger project, yet with your own dedicated Runtime namespace and credentials. Stage and a Production workspaces are provided out of the box, and you are able to add as many workspaces as you need. Please note that the Production workspace will be the one used for submission approval.
