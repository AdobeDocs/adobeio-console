# Distribute an XD Plugin

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for distributing an approved XD Plugin in Adobe Developer Console.

For information on how to begin creating a plugin, please see the [Create an XD Plugin](plugin-project.md) guide.

> **Note:** With the latest release of Adobe Developer Console, XD Plugins are now created as part of a project. XD Plugin Projects are only able to be made using your personal organization. This workflow is not available from within an enterprise organization.
