# Projects overview

All development work in Adobe Developer Console is done as part of a project. A project may include one or multiple products, as well as a combination of APIs, events, runtime, and XD plugins. 

## Personal vs enterprise projects

Projects are a common framework within both personal and enterprise organizations. Projects belonging to an enterprise organization are visible to other members of the organization, whereas projects belonging to a personal organization are visible only to individual to whom the organization belongs.

Use the organization switcher to view the organizations to which you belong and easily switch between them.

> **Note:** For enterprise organizations, you must be a system administrator or developer in order to create projects for your organization. For information on how to manage developers in the admin console, see the [managing developers documentation](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/manage-developers.html)

## Empty projects

Think of an empty project as an open canvas or "blank slate" from which you can add events, runtime, plugins, APIs and more to create custom applications.

To get started, follow the steps provided in the guide for [creating an empty project](projects-empty.md).

## Templated projects

In order to streamline the creation of projects, Adobe Developer Console provides templates that you can use to get up and running quickly. 

> **Note:** Templated projects are currently only available for enterprise organizations.

To get started, follow the steps provided in the guide for [creating a templated project](projects-template.md).
